# Mentor-Mentee Fullstack App

## Overview
This is a fullstack web application designed to connect mentors and mentees. The application features user authentication, mentor search, and individual mentor pages. The client side is built using **React**, while the server side uses **Express**. The database is powered by **PostgreSQL**, and we use **pgAdmin** for database management.
